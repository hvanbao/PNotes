* [swig](http://paularmstrong.github.io/swig/docs/tags/)
  * Swig is an awesome, Django/Jinja-like template engine for node.js.
  * Swig reads template files and translates them into cached javascript functions. When we later render a template we call the evaluated function, passing a context object as an argument.
