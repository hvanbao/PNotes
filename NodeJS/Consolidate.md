  * Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code - anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.

  * Swig reads template files and translates them into cached javascript functions. When we later render a template we call the evaluated function, passing a context object as an argument.
